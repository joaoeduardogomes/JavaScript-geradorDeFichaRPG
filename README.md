## What problem does it solve?
During my time in high school, I played as a Dungeon Master (DM) in a few 3D&T Alpha RPG system campaigns. I always wanted a generator to quickly create simple characters that I could use as NPCs (allies, enemies, or even bosses) in the game. Unfortunately, I never found such a generator, so I decided to create my own years later.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to create a simple and functional character generator. It allows the user to select a class, set a number of points to be distributed among the attributes, or let everything be randomized. The first version of this project was made in Python, and I later decided to create a version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a more visual experience.

## Lessons learned & challenges
Translating the initial Python version of the project into JavaScript was a real challenge. Many aspects didn't work at the beginning, and I had to adapt to the different resources offered by the two languages for dealing with similar problems. 
However, the development of this 2.0 version significantly improved my familiarity with JavaScript and ignited my motivation to create new projects in the future.

## How to use:
 You can easily view the website by visiting the GitHub Pages link: [JS-geradorDeFichaRPG](https://joaoeduardogomes.github.io/JavaScript-geradorDeFichaRPG/).
 The character generator allows the user to create characters based on the 3D&T Alpha system. By visiting the website, you can either select a class for your character or let the attributes be randomized.
 If you choose to specify a class, the generator will prioritize certain attributes according to the characteristics of that class, providing a more tailored character creation experience.
